## Download or clone repo

### `Back-end requirements`

- Download or clone repo of the [backend application](https://github.com/bhavin-devmurari/game-board-api).

- Update allowed origin and put [Local URL]("http://localhost:3000/") or port number where react app will run.

- Run the backend, by default running on port 9000.

### `Front-end or react requirements`

- Client side change : Update BASE_URL in http.common.js file for API and set it to [Local URL]("http://localhost:9000/") with the same port as the [backed rest api application](https://github.com/bhavin-devmurari/game-board-api) is running on 9000 port. So either first change port on backend app.
